## Items
OP Tools adds two new powerful materials, Diamondium and Diamondillium. Players can craft a complete set of tools, weapons, and armor from these materials, as well as decorative ingot blocks.
OP Tools also adds darkmatter ores which can be refined in a refinery used to craft both Diamondium and Diamondillium.

## Issues
I'm still very new to modding and this is basically my first mod so let me know if I broke anything.

## Future Ideas
Enchantments:
    Elemental Damage: Add fire, ice, and/or lightning damage to weapons.

## Usage
If you want to use my mod in anything feel free I only ask I get credits of some kind and maybe a link or two.
