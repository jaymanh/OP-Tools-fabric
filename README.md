# OP Tools
OP tools is a small fabric mod that adds some overpowered tools and their ores. 

## Items
OP Tools adds two new powerful materials, Diamondium and Diamondillium. Players can craft a complete set of tools, weapons, and armor from these materials, as well as decorative ingot blocks.
OP Tools also adds darkmatter ores which is used to craft both Diamondium and Diamondillium.

## Issues
I'm still very new to modding and this is basically my first mod so let me know if I broke anything.

## Future Ideas
I want to add a refined version of darkmatter to make the process of getting the tools more engaging, kind of like how ores are smelted but if you have anyideas I am open to them.

## Usage
If you want to use my mod in anything feel free I only ask I get credits of some kind and maybe a link or two.
